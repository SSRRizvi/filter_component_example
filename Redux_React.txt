Redux: 
Provides predicable state management using actions and reducer

Action:
Describe something has happen but they don't specify how it should be done

Ex:

{
  type: 'CREATE_TODO',
  payload: 'Build my first Redux app'
}

Reducers:
A pure functon that takes the privious state and an action and returns the new state

Sometimes it return the previous state
(state,action) => state

Sometimes it computes new state
(state, action) => state + action.payload

Reducers handle state transitions but they must be done synchronously
 
=============
Observable: it can represent just about anything
1.
it can be transformed in
map, filter, reduce

2. it can be combined

========================================
Merging objects with same properties

var o1 = { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 };
var o2 = { b: 2, c: 2 };
var o3 = { c: 3 };

var obj = Object.assign({}, o1, o2, o3);
console.log(obj); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
